# Exploring Hacker News Posts

In this project we're going to anaylze posts made on the website Hacker News. Hacker News is a webite similar to reddit but more focused on the technology sector. Users submit stories also known as posts, which are voted and commented upon. Two types of posts users make are Ask HN and Show HN, ask posts usually involve individuals asking about certain topics or asking questions while Show HN is more about showing perhaps a project an individual is working on or a program they've created.
